# SufingKeys

This is my favorite Chrome extension, making your browser highly customizable.
The extemsion is all about making keybindings that make your browsing experience much better.
These key bindings are Vim-based, but also highly editable.

## My Config

In the future, I am interested in directly editing the JavaScript code, to get the extension to work how I want.

Current however, I can edit the built-in config file to do most of what I want to do!

This repository is made to hold my config file, in case I loose it.
